## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

#### 1. Role-Based Routing
```javascript
// App.jsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<RoleDashboardRouter />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/wildlife-officer" element={<WildlifeOfficerDashboard />} />
// ... other role-specific routes
```

#### 2. Protected Route Component
```javascript
// ProtectedRoute.jsx
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['admin', 'WildlifeOfficer']}>
  <SensitiveComponent />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

#### 3. Permission Management
```javascript
// usePermissions hook
const { hasPermission, isAdmin, canAccessRoute } = usePermissions();

// Permission Guard component
<PermissionGuard permissions="view_complaints">
  <ComplaintsList />
</PermissionGuard>
```

### Backend Architecture

#### 1. Role Middleware
```javascript
// Enhanced role middleware with detailed error messages
const authorizeRoles = (...allowedRoles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    // Admin has access to everything
    if (req.user.role === 'admin') return next();

    // Check specific role permissions
    if (!allowedRoles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        message: 'Insufficient permissions',
        userRole: req.user.role,
        requiredRoles: allowedRoles
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

#### 2. Route Protection Examples
```javascript
// Protect routes with role requirements
router.get('/bookings', authMiddleware, authorizeRoles('admin', 'WildlifeOfficer'), getBookings);
router.post('/emergency', authMiddleware, authorizeRoles('tourist', 'callOperator'), createEmergency);
```

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication Flow
- **Auth0 Integration:** Secure OAuth2 authentication
- **JWT Tokens:** Stateless authentication with refresh capability
- **Backend Validation:** Double verification of user identity
- **Role Assignment:** Secure role assignment during registration

### 2. Authorization Layers
- **Route Level:** Protected routes with role requirements
- **Component Level:** Conditional rendering based on permissions
- **API Level:** Backend endpoint protection
- **Data Level:** User can only access their own data (with admin override)

### 3. Role Hierarchy
- **Admin Override:** Admin role has access to all system functions
- **Level-Based Access:** Higher level roles can manage lower level roles
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users only get minimum required permissions
- **Audit Trail:** All role-based actions are logged for security

## Testing the Role Management System

### 1. Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test user authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5001/api/test/auth

# Test role verification
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5001/api/test/role
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Testing

#### Admin Access Test
```bash
# Should succeed - Admin can access everything
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/api/admin/users

# Should succeed - Admin can manage bookings
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/api/bookings
```

#### Tourist Access Test
```bash
# Should succeed - Tourist can book activities
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <tourist_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"activityId":"123","date":"2024-01-15","participants":2}' \
     http://localhost:5001/api/bookings

# Should fail - Tourist cannot access admin functions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <tourist_token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/api/admin/users
```

#### Wildlife Officer Access Test
```bash
# Should succeed - Officer can view bookings
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <officer_token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/api/bookings

# Should succeed - Officer can assign drivers
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <officer_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"driverId":"456"}' \
     http://localhost:5001/api/bookings/123/assign-driver
```

### 3. Frontend Role Testing

#### Dashboard Routing Test
1. Login as Tourist ‚Üí Should redirect to `/dashboard/tourist`
2. Login as Admin ‚Üí Should redirect to `/dashboard/admin`
3. Login as Wildlife Officer ‚Üí Should redirect to `/dashboard/wildlife-officer`

#### Component Visibility Test
```javascript
// Test permission-based component rendering
const TestPermissions = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <PermissionGuard permissions="view_complaints">
        <div>Only visible to officers and admins</div>
      </PermissionGuard>

      <RoleGuard roles="tourist">
        <div>Only visible to tourists</div>
      </RoleGuard>

      <AdminOnly>
        <div>Only visible to admins</div>
      </AdminOnly>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. "Access Denied" Errors
**Problem:** User gets 403 Forbidden errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify user role in database matches expected role
- Check if middleware is properly applied to routes
- Ensure JWT token includes role information
- Verify role spelling and case sensitivity

### 2. Dashboard Not Loading
**Problem:** Role-specific dashboard doesn't render
**Solutions:**
- Check if user is fully authenticated (both Auth0 and backend)
- Verify RoleDashboardRouter is correctly importing dashboard components
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoints are responding correctly

### 3. Permission Components Not Working
**Problem:** PermissionGuard components not showing/hiding content
**Solutions:**
- Verify usePermissions hook is returning correct role information
- Check if permissions are correctly defined in roleUtils.js
- Ensure AuthContext is providing backendUser data
- Test with different user roles to isolate the issue

### 4. Backend Route Protection Issues
**Problem:** Protected routes allow unauthorized access
**Solutions:**
- Verify authMiddleware is applied before authorizeRoles
- Check if JWT token is being passed correctly in headers
- Ensure authorizeRoles middleware is imported and used correctly
- Test middleware with logging to debug role checking

## Best Practices

### 1. Security Best Practices
- Always validate user roles on both frontend and backend
- Use principle of least privilege (minimum required permissions)
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Regularly audit role assignments and permissions
- Use HTTPS in production for secure token transmission

### 2. Development Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for better type safety with roles and permissions
- Implement comprehensive testing for all role scenarios
- Document role requirements for each component and route
- Use consistent naming conventions for roles and permissions
- Implement logging for security events and role changes

### 3. User Experience Best Practices
- Provide clear feedback when access is denied
- Show appropriate navigation based on user role
- Implement graceful degradation for missing permissions
- Provide contextual help for role-specific features
- Ensure responsive design works across all dashboards

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Role Features
- **Multi-Role Support:** Users with multiple roles simultaneously
- **Temporary Role Elevation:** Temporary admin access for specific tasks
- **Role Scheduling:** Time-based role assignments
- **Delegation:** Ability to delegate specific permissions temporarily

### 2. Enhanced Security
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Additional security layer for sensitive roles
- **Session Management:** Advanced session control and timeout
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail for all actions
- **Risk Assessment:** Automated risk scoring for user actions

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Role Caching:** Cache user roles and permissions for better performance
- **Lazy Loading:** Load dashboard components only when needed
- **Permission Preloading:** Preload permission data for faster rendering
- **API Optimization:** Optimize API calls based on user permissions

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and maintaining the role management system in Wild Lanka Go. Regular updates to this documentation should be made as the system evolves.
